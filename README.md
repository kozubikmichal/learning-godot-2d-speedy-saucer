# SpeedySaucer ðŸ›¸

A 2D physics-based maze navigation game built with Godot Engine 4.4. Guide your UFO through challenging maze levels while mastering realistic physics-based movement.

## About The Game

SpeedySaucer is a skill-based arcade game where players control a UFO through intricate mazes. The game features realistic physics simulation using Godot's RigidBody2D system, making movement challenging and rewarding to master.

### Key Features

- **Physics-Based Movement**: Realistic UFO controls using force-based physics
- **Challenging Mazes**: Navigate through complex obstacle courses
- **Smooth Camera**: Dynamic camera that follows the player with smooth transitions
- **Intuitive Controls**: WASD and arrow key support for movement
- **Instant Restart**: Quick level restart when touching maze walls

## Controls

| Action | Keys |
|--------|------|
| Move Up | W / Up Arrow |
| Move Down | S / Down Arrow |
| Move Left | A / Left Arrow |
| Move Right | D / Right Arrow |

## How to Play

1. **Objective**: Navigate your green UFO from the START to the END point
2. **Movement**: Use WASD or arrow keys to apply thrust in different directions
3. **Physics**: The UFO has momentum - plan your movements carefully!
4. **Restart**: If you touch the maze walls, the level automatically restarts
5. **Challenge**: Master the physics to complete the maze as quickly as possible

## Technical Details

### Physics System
- Uses Godot's `RigidBody2D` for realistic physics simulation
- Gravity is disabled (`gravity_scale = 0.0`) for space-like movement
- Force-based movement system with configurable thrust values
- Collision detection for maze boundaries

### Input System
- Custom input map with deadzone configuration
- Support for both WASD and arrow keys
- Continuous input processing for smooth movement

### Camera System
- `Camera2D` with position smoothing enabled
- Horizontal and vertical drag for natural following behavior
- Attached to player for dynamic viewpoint

## Development

### Built With
- **Godot Engine 4.4** - Game engine
- **GDScript** - Programming language
- **Custom Assets** - Original sprites and textures
